# MyFirstEC2-
My first EC2 Instance
Signed into my AWS Management Console.
Navigated to the EC2 dashboard.
Clicked on "Launch Instance"
Choose an AMI-Amazon Linux as it's marked "free tier eligible".
I selected an Instance Type which is a T2.micro instance type, which is part of the free tier.
I then Configured to default settings 
I added Storage to the default setting
Then I configured the security to the default as well
Lastly, I reviewed and launched the Instance.
Additionally, I doubled-check my settings and clicked "Launch"
